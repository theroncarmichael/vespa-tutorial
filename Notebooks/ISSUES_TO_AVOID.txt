When setting up the environment for the Jupyter lab, we need to pay attention to the following potential issues :
- Downloading the Dartmouth isochrone pre-computed triangulation takes a while, so we need to have it ready already on the prebuilt environments 
- make sure to use -n 1000 (or so) flags. We need to determine what the correct number is for each test case, or else nothing will get done during the workshop
